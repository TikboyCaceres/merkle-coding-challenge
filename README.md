# Merkle Coding Challenge

I created this app from scratch. I could have used CRA for this challenge but decided to configure the webpack on my own to show you that I am also knowledgeable on this kind of tasks as well not only the designing side of FE but also architecture, best practices, security and even analytics. I created mixins for responsiveness,. I followed tailwinds min-width breakpoints and add them as variables. I also created my own utilities. I hope I have passed the requirement and see that my skills and experience will be valuable to Merkle. Thanks for the oppurtunity and God bless!
